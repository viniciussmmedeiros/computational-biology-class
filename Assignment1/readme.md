Q1:
A) Implement Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.
B) Read n m sequence pairs and save the alignment sequences and score
C) Return the score and identity of the alignment
Scoring Scheme:
Match: +2
Mismatch: -2
Gap: -4

Q2:
Implement Needleman-Wunsch with the following scoring scheme:
Match: +7
Mismatch: -3
Gap: -4

Q3:
A) Implement Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment.
B) Read n m sequence pairs and show the local alignment with the highest score, if
there are multiple local alignments with the same score, show all of them.
C) Return the score and identity of the local alignment with the highest score.
Scoring Scheme:
Match: +1
Mismatch: -1
Gap: -2
